Story Styling Guide Request:
For "{STORY_TITLE}" by {AUTHOR}, please provide a visual styling guide that will work effectively both as digital art and as physical wall art.

1. Color Palette:
   Please provide hex codes and explanations for:

   - Background Color that:
     * Captures the story's primary mood and setting
     * Works well in both digital displays and physical prints
     * Maintains its impact under various lighting conditions

   - Font Color that:
     * Maintains strong readability against the background (minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio)
     * Reflects key themes or symbolic elements from the story
     * Creates visual impact both on screens and in physical form

   - Border Color that:
     * Should be a darker shade of the background color
     * Provides subtle depth and framing
     * Enhances the visual composition without competing with the content

2. Typography:
   Recommend a single typeface that:
   * Captures the story's period and emotional tone
   * Maintains clarity at different viewing distances
   * Reflects the story's pacing and weight
   * Works well in flowing, curved layouts

Please explain how each choice connects to specific themes, motifs, or elements from the story.
