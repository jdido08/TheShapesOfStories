Story Styling Guide Request:

I'm creating artwork called "The Shapes of Stories" which visualizes the narrative journey's (i.e. their ups and down) of a story's protoganist. 

See the attached image for an example of the Shape of Achilles's journey in the "Iliad". 

I need your help creating a story guide for each of the protoganist's in "{Story Title}" by {Author}.

Please provide a visual styling guide that will work effectively both as digital art and as physical wall art.

1. Color Palette:
   Please provide hex codes and explanations for:

   - Background Color that:
     * Captures the story's primary mood and setting
     * Works well in both digital displays and physical prints
     * Maintains its impact under various lighting conditions

   - Font Color that:
     * Maintains strong readability against the background (minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio)
     * Reflects key themes or symbolic elements from the story
     * Creates visual impact both on screens and in physical form

   - Border Color that:
     * Should be a darker shade of the background color
     * Provides subtle depth and framing
     * Enhances the visual composition without competing with the content

2. Typography:
   Recommend a single typeface that:
   * Captures the story's period and emotional tone
   * Maintains clarity at different viewing distances
   * Reflects the story's pacing and weight
   * Works well in flowing, curved layouts

Please explain how each choice connects to specific themes, motifs, or elements from the story.

Example response for The Old Man and the Sea:
Background: #1B4B6F (Deep Sea Blue)
- Evokes the depth of the Caribbean Sea
- Deep enough to suggest isolation while maintaining richness in various lighting

Font Color: #E2D5C3 (Weathered Bone White)
- Contrast ratio: 7.8:1 (excellent readability)
- References weathered fishing boats, sun-bleached bones, and Santiago's endurance
- Maintains clarity in both digital and printed forms

Border: #123247 (Darkened Sea Blue)
- Deeper shade that frames without overwhelming
- Creates subtle depth that enhances both digital and physical displays

Font: Crimson Pro
- Balances maritime strength with quiet dignity
- Clean letterforms that remain legible when flowing along curves
- Suggests traditional craftsmanship while maintaining modern clarity
