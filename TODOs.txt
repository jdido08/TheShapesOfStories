- revisit story components analysis (not getting the shapes I really want with current approach). I'm wondering if I need a 3 step approach:
    -> aggregate
    -> normalize (e.g. get rid of background components; that should influence where persons starts). 
    -> segement (story_components)
- revisit story style components (maybe feed in popular book covers)
