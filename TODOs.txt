_________
11/17/2025:
- incorporate artwork into story style selection
- create mockup that includes the cover 
- maybe rethink about how to specify story cover in creation pipeline 


11/10/2025:
 - cleaned up story summary --> seperating backstory and mainstory; only feeding main story summary into story components -- done
 - need to revisit story components 
    - make sure description capture events which describe the emotional change 
- need to revisit story style to make sure:
    - I capture import covers ==> I think it makes sense to use the covers on goodreads as those are the cover's folks are familar with
    - I create a consistent branding experience --> the branding experience is that it just reflects the book covers 
    - consider creating new mockup that actually shows the cover image of the book


11/7/2025:
- story summary 
    --> divide into backstory and main_story 
    --> only feed main_story into summary

- story_components:
    --> need to revisit --> need simpler shapes 


- story_style:
    - need more consistent aestic for brand 
    - think about feeding in story covers 




11/5/2025:
- revisit story components analysis (not getting the shapes I really want with current approach). I'm wondering if I need a 3 step approach:
    -> aggregate
    -> normalize (e.g. seperate out background components; that should influence where persons starts). 
    -> segement (story_components)
- revisit story style components (maybe feed in popular book covers)
