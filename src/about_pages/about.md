# The Shapes of Stories About

We love stories. We read, listen, watch them for fun. It's by accident they become our obesssion. We have Kurt Vonnegut to thank most. He has a simple idea that captivated us. *Every story has a shape.* 

It’s an idea so simple you can draw it on a napkin, yet so powerful it changes how you see every story you’ve ever loved. Here are the basics.

## The Building Blocks-
Every story can be drawn on a simple graph.

- The vertical (GI) axis is Fortune. Good is up, Ill is down.
- The horizontal (BE) axis is Time, from Beginning to End.

A character's jounrey is built from a few symbols that show which way life is going, and how fast.
- → Stasis: No change.
- ↑ Rise: A change for the better. The more arrows (↑↑, ↑↑↑), the more sudden and dramatic the rise.
- ↓ Fall: A change for the worse. The more arrows (↓↓, ↓↓↓), the more sudden and catastrophic the fall.


## The Common Shapes 
History never repeats but it does rhyme. The same is true for stories. While every narrative journey is unique, many follow a few powerful, time-tested shapes. Here are some of the most common:

1. Rags to Riches
2. From Bad to Worse
3. Man in Hole
4. Boy Meets Girl 
5. Icarus
6. Cinderella
