Perfect—here are your **clean prompts (no on-image annotations)**. They produce blank, photoreal mockups; you’ll add the badges later in your editor.

# 8×10 variant (attach to the 8×10 size)

## 1) Hero — wall, **with mat** (8×10 → 11×14 frame)

```
A single 8×10 print displayed in an 11×14 slim matte-black frame WITH a WHITE MAT, hung on a clean white wall. The print area is BLANK (no text/art), fine-art paper with a subtle EGGSHELL texture. Camera STRAIGHT-ON; edges perfectly parallel, no keystone. Soft window light from left; gentle right-side wall shadow; subtle realistic glass reflection (no harsh glare). Minimal literary styling below: a narrow floating shelf with 3 neutral clothbound books and a small stoneware vase; airy, uncluttered, bookish mood. Detail accuracy: visible mat bevel; mat window sized for 8×10 (~7.5×9.5 in visible); crisp mitered corners; true paper whites. Technical: 55mm, f/5.6, ISO 200, 1/125s, neutral WB, sRGB. Aspect ratio 3:2. Do not render any text anywhere.
```

## 2) Poster-only — flat-lay, **no frame**

```
Top-down flat-lay of a single 8×10 fine-art poster on neutral off-white mat board. Paper is BLANK (no text/art), subtle EGGSHELL texture, perfectly rectangular. Orthographic/top-down camera to avoid perspective skew. Soft north-facing window light from upper-left; gentle realistic shadows. Sparse literary props arranged with negative space and NOT touching edges: one closed linen hardcover (spine unreadable), a fountain pen, a few brass paperclips. Technical: 50mm equivalent, f/5.6, ISO 200, 1/125s; grid-level alignment (0° rotation); no barrel distortion. Aspect ratio 4:5. No text anywhere.
```

## 3) Table vignette — **no mat** (frame = 8×10)

```
A single 8×10 print inside a slim matte-black frame WITHOUT a mat, leaning against a white wall on a light oak console table. The print area is BLANK, smooth, uniform; subtle EGGSHELL paper behind glass; soft realistic reflection only. Minimal literary props: a stack of 2–3 neutral clothbound classics, a small ceramic bud vase, and a porcelain coffee cup; understated and not overlapping the frame. Camera straight-on at mid-height; perfect verticals/horizontals. Soft daylight from left, mild wall shadow. Technical: 50–70mm, f/4, ISO 200, 1/125s, neutral WB, sRGB. Aspect ratio 3:2. No text anywhere.

Camera STRAIGHT-ON; parallel edges; zero keystone. Soft window light from left; delicate right-side wall shadow; gentle glass reflection. Minimal, bookish styling below: a narrow floating shelf with 3–4 neutral clothbound books and a small stoneware vase. Detail accuracy: true mat bevel; mat window for 11×14 (~10.5×13.5 in visible); crisp mitered corners; true paper whites. Technical: 55mm, f/5.6, ISO 200, 1/125s, neutral WB, sRGB. Aspect ratio 3:2.

# Attach to **both** variants

## 7) Two-size comparison — side-by-side, **both matted**

```
Two framed prints on a white wall, photographed STRAIGHT-ON. LEFT: 11×14 print in a 16×20 slim matte-black frame WITH WHITE MAT. RIGHT: 8×10 print in an 11×14 slim matte-black frame WITH WHITE MAT. Both print areas are BLANK (no text/art), fine-art EGGSHELL paper. Mount frames at the same centerline with a clearly visible 3–4 inch gap; size difference must be obvious at a glance. Soft window light from left; soft-edged wall shadows. Below: a narrow shelf with a tidy stack of neutral clothbound books and a small ceramic vase; minimal, literary styling. Detail accuracy: true mat bevels; mat windows ~10.5×13.5 (for 11×14) and ~7.5×9.5 (for 8×10); crisp frame corners. Technical: 50–60mm, f/5.6, ISO 200, 1/125s, neutral WB, sRGB.

All print areas are BLANK (no text/art), fine-art EGGSHELL paper. Equal spacing (clean 3–4 inch gaps), shared centerline, perfectly level. Soft window light from left; gentle, consistent wall shadows. Optional minimal shelf below with 2–3 neutral clothbound books; keep airy and bookish.

## Quick badge/annotation style guide (for your editor)

* **Placement:** bottom-left; 24–32 px margin from edges (at 3000–4000 px long side).
* **Size:** \~10–12 px text at 3000 px width (\~18–20 px at 6000 px).
* **Look:** 15–20% black rounded rectangle, 6–8 px padding; text at 85–90% white; sans (Inter/Helvetica).
* **Copy examples:**

  * `Print 8×10 • Frame 11×14 • Mat ~7.5×9.5 — Print only`
  * `Print 11×14 • Frame 16×20 • Mat ~10.5×13.5 — Print only`

If you want, I can generate a tiny transparent **SVG badge template** you can drop into Figma/Photoshop for consistent sizing.
