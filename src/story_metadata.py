# BASIC IDEA:
# 1.) Get Metadata on story using OpenLibrary, Wikidata, Google Books, etc..
#   - genre(s)
#   - setting(s) --> city, state, region, etc.. 
#   - theme(s)
#   - associated country
#   - series/universe ???
#.  - awards ??
# 2.) Use LLM to clean up and normalize metadata 
# NOTE: the metadata here is NOT exhaustive. I think a lot fo collections will be manually assembled but this process can still be useful 


# why:
# meatadata will help:
# - the ability to search for stories
# - the ability to more easily create collections e.g. 
#   - The Shapes of Pittsburgh
#   - The Shapes of Love 
#   - The Shapes
