# The Shapes of Stories About

We love stories. We read, listen, watch them for fun. It's by accident they become our obesssion. We have Kurt Vonnegut to thank most. He has a simple idea that captivated us. *Every story has a shape.* 

It’s an idea so simple you can draw it on a napkin, yet so powerful it changes how you see every story you’ve ever loved. Here are the basics.

## The Building Blocks
Imagine a simple graph.
- The Vertical Axis (G-I): This maps a character's fortune, from Good Fortune (health, wealth, happiness) at the top to Ill Fortune (sickness, poverty, misery) at the bottom.
- The Horizontal Axis (B-E): This is simply the timeline of the story, from Beginning to End.

A story’s plot is the line that moves across this graph, and that line is created using just three basic movements:
- Rise (↑): A character's fortune improves. Life gets better.
- Fall (↓): A character's fortune worsens. Life gets harder.
- Stasis (→): A character's fortune remains the same.


## The Common Shapes 
History never repeats but it does rhyme. The same is true for stories. While every narrative journey is unique, many follow a few powerful, time-tested shapes. Here are some of the most common:

1. Rags to Riches
2. From Bad to Worse
3. Man in Hole
4. Boy Meets Girl 
5. Icarus
7. Cinderella
