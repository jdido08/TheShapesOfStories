        "summary": "For 84 days, the old fisherman Santiago has caught nothing. Alone, impoverished, and facing his own mortality, Santiago is now considered unlucky. So Manolin has been constrained by his parents to fish in another, more productive boat. Every evening, though, when Santiago again returns empty-handed, Manolin helps carry home the old man's equipment, keeps him company, and brings him food. On the morning of the 85th day, Santiago sets out before dawn on a three-day odyssey that takes him far out to sea. In search of an epic catch, he eventually does snag a marlin of epic proportions, enduring tremendous hardship to land the great fish. He straps the marlin along the length of his skiff and heads for home, hardly believing his own victory. Within an hour, a mako shark attacks the marlin, tearing away a great hunk of its flesh and mutilating Santiago's prize. Santiago fights the mako, enduring great suffering, and eventually kills it with his harpoon, which he loses in the struggle. The great tear in the marlin's flesh releases the fish's blood and scent into the water, attracting packs of shovel-nosed sharks. With whatever equipment remains on board, Santiago repeatedly fights off the packs of these scavengers, enduring exhaustion and great physical pain, even tearing something in his chest. Eventually, the sharks pick the marlin clean. Defeated, Santiago reaches shore and beaches the skiff. Alone in the dark, he looks back at the marlin's skeleton in the reflection from a street light and then stumbles home to his shack, falling face down onto his cot in exhaustion. The next morning, Manolin finds Santiago in his hut and cries over the old man's injuries. Manolin fetches coffee and hears from the other fisherman what he had already seen -- that the marlin's skeleton lashed to the skiff is eighteen feet long, the greatest fish the village has known. Manolin sits with Santiago until he awakes and then gives the old man some coffee. The old man tells Manolin that he was beaten. But Manolin reassures him that the great fish didn't beat him and that they will fish together again, that luck doesn't matter, and that the old man still has much to teach him. That afternoon, some tourists see the marlin's skeleton waiting to go out with the tide and ask a waiter what it is. Trying to explain what happened to the marlin, the waiter replies, \"Eshark.\" But the tourists misunderstand and assume that's what the skeleton is. Back in his shack, with Manolin sitting beside him, Santiago sleeps again and dreams of the young lions he had seen along the coast of Africa when he was a young man.",

        "summary": "The novel opens with an explanation of how Santiago, the old Cuban fisherman, has not caught a single fish in eighty-four days. For the initial forty-four days, a boy named Manolin had kept company with the old man. Then Santiago, because of his ill fortune, is termed Salao, meaning bad luck. As a result, Manolins parents forbid the boy from travelling with Santiago and order him to go on another boat, which catches many fish. The boy is saddened at the prospect of deserting old Santiago, whom he admires as a father. The old man also sorely misses the company of the young boy, who ran small errands for him, often brought him food, and was like a son. It is not the first time that Santiago has had a stretch of bad luck in his fishing career. He tells Manolin that he once went without catching a fish for eighty-seven days, but then his luck changed. Now Santiago is quite confident that he will succeed again because he knows a few \"tricks\" about the sea and is still strong enough to land a really big fish. He feels hopeful that his luck will soon turn again. Some of the other fisherman make fun of old Santiago and his bad luck; other fisherman, who know Santiagos real worth and talent, regard his situation with sadness. The old man lets neither the teasing nor the pity affect him in any measure. On the morning of the eighty-fifth day, Santiago plans to set out early and go far out into the sea. Before he departs, Manolin comes to wish the old man good luck and bring him coffee. Before it is light, Santiago rows his weather beaten skiff away from the shore, starting his fateful trip. At his age, Santiago should probably fish close to the shore, but he ventures far out. His bravery is not the foolhardiness of an unthinking and blind hero; nor is it the last resort of a desperate man whose patience has run thin, after waiting eighty-four days to catch a fish. Instead his bravery comes with self-confidence; his alert mind and active body are fully prepared to face any contingency. Santiago is a sensitive soul who loves mankind and nature. He sees different types of birds and feels a oneness with them. He considers the flying fish and the dolphins his friends. He thinks of the sea as a kind and beautiful, but willful, woman, who showers both favors and curses when one least expects them. He is also a cautious and observant fisherman. He slowly and carefully puts out his hooks, covered with tuna and sardines, at different depths and rows. Santiago also refuses to let his past luck cast a shadow over his present opportunity. At about noon on the first day, Santiago spies a bird in the sky; it is a man-of-war, come to feed on fish. It is a significant sign for the old fisherman, because the bird has probably spied flying fish, which are also eaten by dolphins. The dolphins, in turn, will attract the tuna, which attract the marlin. It is a big marlin that Santiago really wants to catch. Before long, he hooks a large fish, which seems to be a marlin; he wishes he knew its size so he could estimate what he is up against. When Santiago tries to pull the fish in, the catch is so heavy that the line threatens to break and the boat almost capsizes. The fish begins to pull the boat in a northwestern direction. Santiago lets the marlin continue to tug, hoping it will tire out and come to the surface. He is also waiting for dusk, because the setting sun often attracts fish to the surface. The day draws to a close; the sun goes down, and the stars start glittering in the sky, but the fish still does not come to the surface or alter its course. Santiago prepares to wait out the night, even though the big fish is taking him further from the shore and the glimmering lights of Havana. Santiago begins to think about the fish on the end of the line and empathizes with it. Although he has caught many giant marlins in the past, this fish seems different and special; it knows to stay away from the shore, where it can be more easily caught. Other fish start taking Santiagos bait, but he cuts off all the lines in order to concentrate on the huge fish. At times, he wishes that the boy were with him, but he does not let the fact that he is alone on the sea worry him; instead, he determines that he will kill the fish before sunset, no matter what happens. The fish, however, does not come up to the surface; consequently, Santiago is unable to kill it before the darkness sets in. The night is calm and uneventful. The second day dawns without any major change in either the fish or Santiagos position. The fish is still showing as much strength, courage, determination, and endurance as Santiago. He continues to swim and tow the boat against the current. Santiago hopes that soon the fish will turn into the current, proving that it is tiring. Santiago admits that he himself is beginning to feel a bit tired. In order stay awake, Santiago has a steady conversation with himself, with the fish, or with the birds that come to rest on the boat. Suddenly the fish pulls the line with such a strong, quick jerk that if Santiago were not fully alert; the boat would have capsized. When it is calm again, he notices that his right hand has a deep gash in it and is bleeding profusely. He dips his bleeding hand in the water to stop the blood from flowing out. He believes that both he and the fish are now hurting. Santiago wishes he could see the fish that he has caught, but it remains tantalizingly beneath the surface of the water. Being a pragmatic man, Santiago knows that he will need both of his hands and his whole body in top working condition if he is to master the fish and then return safely to shore. He is worried about the cut in his right hand and the cramps in his left. He first tries to tend to his hurting hands; then in order to preserve his strength, he eats some raw tuna. While he eats, he worries that both of his hands are temporarily useless, one being cut, one having cramps, and both being used to help him eat. He wonders what he would do if the fish jumped when his hands were idle. At noon, the fish surfaces dramatically and majestically ahead of the boat. It is almost as if the noble creature were staging a magnificent drama before Santiago to show him exactly what he is up against. The giant marlin is more than eighteen feet long with a dark purple head and lavender-striped back and sides. Santiago imagines that the fish weighs more than fifteen hundred pounds. It is not the first time that Santiago has caught such a huge fish, but it is the first time that he is alone, waging a physical and psychological battle against a powerful giant. Although he marvels at the size and strength of the fish, Santiago feels that he has the upper hand because of his human will and intelligence. Though he is not overtly religious, Santiago begins to pray, begging for help in holding on to and killing the fish. Although the prayers do not ease his physical suffering, they encourage his mental tenacity. He declares that he will show the fish \"what a man can do and what a man endure\" and begins to concentrate on holding on to the line and preserving his strength. As Santiagos left hand is still cramping, he uses his right hand to hold line, but it cuts the hand more deeply. The fish turns east of north, still towing the boat, while Santiago holds the line. The old man tries to ignore his tiredness and the pain in his shoulders caused by the line. Instead, he thinks about lions on the beach and about Joe DiMaggio, the great American baseball player known for his supreme strength and courage; both images serve as inspirations to him. To bolster his courage further, Santiago remembers the time he had been victorious in a game that hand been tied for more than a day. As the sun begins to sink below the western horizon on this second day, Santiago wonders what the night will bring. Thus far, the fish has not altered his course or changed its depth for long; therefore, the line remains as taut as ever in his right hand. With his left hand, Santiago catches a dolphin, which he immediately eats. He criticizes himself for having come out to sea without salt or lime, thinking the dolphin meat would taste better with either. He also reproaches himself for not drying out some salt from the seawater during the heat of the day. Feeling a bit refreshed after eating, Santiago counts his blessings. His right hand is healing, his left hand is no longer cramping, and his legs are strong; additionally, Santiago still feels that he has a great advantage over the fish, which has a hook in its throat and an empty belly, since it has not eaten in two days. Then Santiago begins to admire the giant fish, feeling it has exhibited tremendous dignity in its bearing. He feels that the people who will eventually eat it are really not worthy of such a marvelous creature. Thinking such thoughts, the old man drifts off to sleep for about two hours; it is the first rest he has had in two days. Santiago knows that sleeping is necessary if he is to keep his head clear. As the third day dawns, the weather deteriorates. Santiago predicts that there will be a hurricane before long. The contest between the old man and the fish also grows more intense. Santiago is extremely fatigued, and the cramps return to his left hand. In truth, his whole body is racked with pain, but he convinces himself that \"pain does not matter to a man.\" Santiago thinks that the fish must also be feeling pain, for it has started to circle. As a result, the old man increases the strain on the line, hoping that the circles will become shorter. He dreams of the fish coming to the surface, close to the boat, so close that Santiago can kill it. The old man sees the fish on its third turn and again appreciates its sheer size and beauty. He keeps his harpoon close by and ready, hoping that the fish will soon come close enough for him to kill, preferably by striking its heart not its head. After several failed tries, Santiago successfully spears the great fish just before noon. When it is still, the fisherman passes a line through its gills and mouth and makes a noose around its tail and another round its middle; he then ties the fish to the boat. Feeling triumphant, Santiago prepares to go home. Santiago is blissfully unaware of the presence of sharks that have been attracted by the blood of the giant fish. He catches and eats a few shrimps, trying to renew some of his energy. He then spies the first sharks and attacks them with his harpoon; unfortunately, he loses the harpoon in the battle. As a result, the sharks begin to bite off large chunks from the fish. The old man makes an improvised harpoon from his oar and fights all night to defend the giant fish he has caught. It is, however, a losing battle; during the night, the sharks devour the entire fish. By dawn, only the bare skeleton is left. Sad and in pain, Santiago departs for home with the skeleton tied to his boat. Totally exhausted, Santiago reaches the shore; after caring for his boat, he begins to climb the hill towards his hut. He is so weak and weary that he falls several times. Finally reaching the hut, he falls on the bed and thankfully sinks into a deep slumber. Because of the storm, the fishermen have not gone out. They see the huge skeleton of the fish, admire its gigantic size, and feel pity for the old man whose incredible efforts have been wasted. They do not understand that Santiago has really won a victory. In catching the fish, the old man has demonstrated grace under pressure, mans supremacy over his circumstances, and his ability to withstand terrible odds. The boy Manolin goes to the hut to see Santiago, kindly bringing him coffee. The boy cries when he sees the old mans bleeding hands. The gentle Santiago comforts him. Together, they plan to go fishing again. Manolin leaves Santiago alone so he can sleep; the old man dreams of the lions on the African beach.",

        "summary": "There is an old fisherman in Cuba, Santiago, who has gone eighty-four days without a catch. He is \"thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck,...and his hands had deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert\" . Santiago's lack of success, though, does not destroy his spirit, as his \"cheerful and undefeated\" eyes show . He has a single friend, a boy named Manolin, who helped him during the first forty days of his dryspell. After forty days, though, Manolin's parents decided the old man was unlucky and ordered their son to join another boat. Despite this, the boy helps the old man to bring in his empty boat every day. Santiago tells Manolin that tomorrow he will go out far in the Gulf to fish. The two gather Santiago's things from his boat and go to the old man's house. His house is very simple with a bed, table, and chair on a dirt floor. The two friends speak for a while, then Manolin leaves briefly to get food. Santiago falls asleep. When Manolin returns, he wakes Santiago. The two eat the food the boy has brought. During the course of the meal, the boy realizes the squalor in which the old man lives and reminds himself to bring the old man a shirt, shoes, a jacket, and a blanket for the coming winter. Manolin and Santiago talk baseball for a while, and the boy then leaves to be woken in the morning by the old man. Santiago sleeps. Santiago dreams of Africa, where he traveled as a shipmate in his youth. \"He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats come riding through it....He dreamed of places now and lions on the beach\" . The old man wakes and retrieves the boy from his house. The two take the old man's supplies from his shack to his boat and enjoy coffee at an early morning place that serves fisherman. The boy leaves to fetch the sardines for the old man. When he returns, he wishes the old man luck, and Santiago goes out to sea. Santiago leaves shore early in the morning, before sunrise. \"He knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean\" . Soon, Santiago rows over the \"great well,\" a sudden drop of seven hundred fathoms where shrimp, bait fish, and squid congregate. Moving along, Santiago spots flying fish and birds, expressing great sympathy for the latter. As he queries, \"Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel....\" . Santiago keeps pressing out, past the great well where he has been recently unsuccessful. Santiago sees a man-of-war bird overhead and notices that the bird has spied something in the water. The old man follows near the bird, and drops his own lines into the area, hoping to capture the fish the bird has seen. There is a large school of dolphin traveling fast, too fast for either the bird or Santiago to capture. Santiago moves on, hoping to catch a stray or perhaps even discover a marlin tracking the school. He catches a small tuna after not too long and then feels a bite on one of his deeper lines. The first bite is hard, and the stick to which the line is connected drops sharply. The next tug is more tentative, but Santiago knows exactly what it is. \"One hundred fathoms down a marlin was eating the sardines that covered the point and the shank of the hook where the hand-forged hook projected from the head of the small tuna\" . Encouraged by a bite at so deep a depth so far out in the Gulf, Santiago reasons that the fish much be very large. The marlin nibbles around the hook for some time, refusing to take the bait fully. Santiago speaks aloud, as if to cajole the fish into accepting the bait. He says, \"Come on....Make another turn. Just smell them. Aren't they lovely? Eat them good now and then there is the tuna. Hard and cold and lovely. Don't be shy fish. Eat them\" . After many false bites, the marlin finally takes the tuna and pulls out a great length of line. Santiago waits a bit for the marlin to swallow the hook and then pulls hard on the line to bring the marlin up to the surface. The fish is strong, though, and does not come up. Instead, he swims away, dragging the old man and his skiff along behind. Santiago wishes he had Manolin with him to help. As the sun goes down, the marlin continues on in the same direction, and Santiago loses sight of land altogether. Expressing his resolve, Santiago says, \"Fish,...I'll stay with you until I am dead\" . He expresses ambivalence over whether he wants the fish to jump, wanting to end the struggle as quickly as possible but worrying that the hook might slip out of the fish's mouth. Echoing his former resolve though with less certainty, Santiago says, \"Fish,...I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends\" . A small bird land on the boat, and while Santiago is speaking to the bird, the marlin lurches forward and pulls the old man down, cutting his hand. Lowering his hand to water to clean it, Santiago notices that the marlin has slowed down. He decides to eat a tuna he has caught in order to give him strength for his ordeal. As he is cutting the fish, though, his left hand cramps. \"What kind of hand is that,\" Santiago says, \"Cramp then if you want. Make yourself into a claw. It will do you no good\" . The old man eats the tuna, hoping it will renew his strength and help release his hand. Just then, the marlin comes out of the water quickly and descends into the water again. Santiago is amazed by its size, two feet longer than the skiff. He realizes that the marlin could destroy the boat if he wanted to and says, \"...hank God, they are not as intelligent as we who kill them; although they are more noble and more able\" . Santiago says prayers to assuage his worried heart, and settles into the chase once again. As the sun sets, Santiago thinks back to triumphs of his past in order to give himself more confidence in the present. He remembers a great arm-wrestling match he had at a tavern in Casablanca. It had lasted a full day and a night, but Santiago, El Campeon as he was known then, eventually won. \"He decided that he could beat anyone if he wanted to badly enough and he decided that it was bad for his right hand for fishing\" . He tried to wrestle with his left hand but it was a traitor then as it had been now. Recalling his exhaustion, Santiago decides that he must sleep some if he is to kill the marlin. He cuts up the dolphin he has caught to prevent spoiling, and eats some of it before contriving a way to sleep. Santiago wraps the line around himself and leans against the bow to anchor himself, leaving his left hand on the rope to wake him if the marlin lurches. Soon, the old man is asleep, dreaming of a school of porpoises, his village house, and finally of the lions of his youth on the African beach. Santiago is awoken by the line rushing furiously through his right hand. The marlin leaps out of the water and it is all the old man can do to hold onto the line, now cutting his hand badly and dragging him down to the bottom of the skiff. Santiago finds his balance, though, and realizes that the marlin has filled the air sacks on his back and cannot go deep to die. The marlin will circle and then the endgame will begin. At sunrise, the marlin begins a large circle. Santiago holds the line strongly, pulling it in slowly as the marlin goes round. At the third turn, Santiago sees the fish and is amazed by its size. He readies the harpoon and pulls the line in more. The marlin tries desperately to pull away. Santiago, no longer able to speak for lack of water, thinks, \"You are killing me, fish....But you have a right to. Never have I seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother. Come on and kill me. I do not care who kills you\" . This marlin continues to circle, coming closer and pulling out. At last it is next to the skiff, and Santiago drove his harpoon into the marlin's chest. \"Then the fish came alive, with his death in him, and rose high out of the water showing all his great length and width and all his power and his beauty\" . It crashed into the sea, blinding Santiago with a shower of sea spray. With the glimpse of vision he had, Santiago saw the slain beast laying on its back, crimson blood disseminating into the azure water. Seeing his prize, Santiago says, \"I am a tired old man. But I have killed this fish which is my brother and now I must do the slave work\" . Having killed the Marlin, Santiago lashes its body alongside his skiff. He pulls a line through the marlin's gills and out its mouth, keeping its head near the bow. \"I want to see him, he thought, and to touch and to feel him. He is my fortune, he thought\" . Having secured the marlin to the skiff, Santiago draws the sail and lets the trade wind push him toward the southwest. An hour after Santiago killed the marlin, a mako shark appears. It had followed the trail of blood the slain marlin left in its wake. As the shark approaches the boat, Santiago prepares his harpoon, hoping to kill the shark before it tears apart the marlin. \"The shark's head was out of water and his back was coming out and the old man could hear the noise of skin and flesh ripping on the big fish when he rammed the harpoon down onto the shark's head\" . The dead shark slowly sinks into the deep ocean water. Two hours later, two shovel-nosed sharks arrive at the skiff. After losing his harpoon to the mako, Santiago fastens his knife to the end of the oar and now wields this against the sharks. He kills the first shark easily, but while he does this, the other shark is ripping at the marlin underneath the boat. Santiago lets go of the sheet to swing broadside and reveal the shark underneath. After some struggle, he kills this shark as well. Santiago apologizes to the fish for the mutilation he has suffered. He admits, \"I shouldn't have gone out so far, fish....Neither for you nor for me. I am sorry, fish\" . Tired and losing hope, Santiago sits and waits for the next attacker, a single shovel-nosed shark. The old man succeeds in killing the fish but breaks his knife blade in the process. More sharks appear at sunset and Santiago only has a club with which to beat them away. He does not kill the sharks, but damages them enough to prevent their return. Santiago then looks forward to nightfall as he will be able to see the lights of Havana, guiding him back to land. He regrets not having cleaved off the marlin's sword to use as a weapon when he had the knife and apologizes again to the fish. At around ten o'clock, he sees the light of Havana and steers toward it. In the night, the sharks return. \"y midnight he fought and this time he knew the fight was useless. They came in a pack and he could only see the lines in the water their fins made and their phosphorescence as they threw themselves on the fish\" . He clubs desperately at the fish, but the club was soon taken away by a shark. Santiago grabs the tiller and attacks the sharks until the tiller breaks. \"That was the last shark of the pack that came. There was nothing more for them to eat\" . Santiago \"sailed lightly now and he had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind\" . He concentrates purely on steering homewards and ignores the sharks that came to gnaw on the marlin's bones. When he arrives at the harbor, everyone is asleep. Santiago steps out of the boat, carrying the mast back to his shack. \"He started to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time with the mast across his shoulder. He tried to get up. But it was too difficult and he sat there with the mast on his shoulder and looked at the road\" . When he finally arose, he had to sit five times before reaching home. Arriving at his shack, Santiago collapsed on his bed and fell asleep. Manolin arrives at the shack while Santiago is still asleep. The boy leaves quickly to get some coffee for Santiago, crying on his way to the Terrace. Manolin sees fisherman gathered around the skiff, measuring the marlin at eighteen feet long. When Manolin returns to the shack, Santiago is awake. The two speak for a while, and Manolin says, \"Now we will fish together again,\" To which Santiago replies, \"No. I am not lucky. I am not lucky anymore\" . Manolin objects, \"The hell with luck....I'll bring the luck with me\" . Santiago acquiesces and Manolin leaves to fetch food and a shirt. That afternoon there are tourists on the Terrace. A female tourist sees the skeleton of the marlin moving in the tide. Not recognizing the skeleton, she asks the waiter what it is. He responds in broken English \"eshark,\" thinking she wants to know what happened. She comments to her partner that she didn't know sharks had such beautiful tails. Meanwhile, back in Santiago's shack, the old man \"was still sleeping on his face and the boy was sitting by him watching him. The old man was dreaming about lions\" .",

        "summary": "The story begins, as you might expect, with an old man. He is a fisherman who has not caught a fish in 84 days. He is also not eating very much. The two factors are related. We also meet a boy who is dear friends with the old man. The old man taught him to fish when he was young, and the boy brings the old man food. Does our language sound elementary and clipped? That's because Hemingway's prose is. His is just eight million times better than ours.So that sets the stage. We'd also like to note that the old man has a name , as does the young boy , but the text always refers to them as \"the old man\" and \"the boy.\" So this old man goes to sleep dreaming of the lions he used to see back in the day in Africa. He wakes before sunrise and does what fishermen do--get in his boat and head out to fish.Not too long after that, the old man hooks a really, really, ridiculously big fish. A \"marlin\" to be more exact. An earth-shattering struggle of mythical proportions follows. Most of the novella consists of this struggle, which lasts over three days. It is a battle of strength and of wills. The old man sees the fish as his brother, not his enemy, yet he never wavers in his resolution to kill the thing. Which, ultimately, he does.But this is no happy ending. It's just a happy mid-point followed by an extraordinarily sad ending. The old man straps the fish to the side of the boat and heads home. On the way, he is attacked by sharks, who slowly but surely eat away at the marlin while the old man, starving and exhausted, tries to beat them off with a harpoon, a club, and finally nothing but a simple knife. By the time he makes it back to shore, there is nothing left of the fish but a skeleton. The old man goes to sleep and dreams of the same lions of his youth--we like to imagine it's something similar to The Lion King.",

        "description": "*The Old Man and the Sea* is one of Hemingway's most enduring works. Told in language of great simplicity and power, it is the story of an old Cuban fisherman, down on his luck, and his supreme ordeal -- a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. \r\n\r\nHere Hemingway recasts, in strikingly contemporary style, the classic theme of courage in the face of defeat, of personal triumph won from loss. Written in 1952, this hugely successful novella confirmed his power and presence in the literary world and played a large part in his winning the 1954 Nobel Prize for Literature.",
