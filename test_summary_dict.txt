After serving nineteen years in the galleys for stealing a loaf of bread and for several escape attempts, Jean Valjean is released, but his past as a convict haunts him. Refused shelter everywhere, he is taken in by the saintly Bishop Myriel, whose silverware he promptly steals. When the police capture Valjean, the Bishop saves him with a pious lie, claiming the silver was a gift and making Valjean promise to live an honest life. This act of mercy sparks a life-altering transformation.

Adopting the name Monsieur Madeleine, Valjean becomes a prosperous factory owner and the beloved mayor of Montreuil-sur-mer, using his wealth to help the poor. His life is disrupted when he must save Fantine, a former employee who, fired without his knowledge, has fallen into prostitution. He promises the dying woman he will care for her daughter, Cosette. Valjean’s new life collapses when another man is mistakenly identified as him. After a night of agonizing moral conflict, Valjean reveals his true identity in court to save the innocent man. He is arrested at Fantine's bedside by his long-time pursuer, Inspector Javert, and the shock kills her.

Valjean is sent back to prison but escapes by faking his death during the rescue of a sailor. He retrieves the abused Cosette from the villainous Thénardiers and takes her to Paris, raising her as his own daughter. For years they live in hiding, always just ahead of Javert. After a dramatic chase, they find a peaceful refuge in a convent where Valjean works as a gardener and Cosette is a student.

When Cosette is a young woman, Valjean leaves the convent so she may experience the world. She falls in love with a young student, Marius Pontmercy. Valjean, hostile to the man usurping his place in Cosette’s affections and disturbed by political unrest, decides to flee to England. Despairing at losing Cosette, Marius joins a student insurrection, intending to die. Valjean's conscience drives him to the barricade, not to fight, but to protect Marius for Cosette’s sake. There, he encounters the captured Javert but, instead of executing him, sets him free.

As the barricade falls, Valjean finds a gravely wounded and unconscious Marius and carries him on a harrowing journey through the Paris sewers. He is arrested by Javert at the exit, but the inspector, shattered by Valjean’s mercy, allows him to take Marius home before releasing him and taking his own life.

Marius recovers and marries Cosette. Valjean confesses his criminal past to Marius, who, unaware that Valjean saved his life, slowly estranges the old man from Cosette. Without her, Valjean’s life loses its meaning, and he begins to wither away. However, Thénardier, in an attempt to blackmail Marius, unwittingly reveals that Valjean was his savior. Marius and Cosette rush to Valjean's side, and he dies content in a joyful reunion, having found their love and forgiveness.
