After nineteen years in prison and the galleys for stealing a loaf of bread and for multiple escape attempts, Jean Valjean was released. In the town of Digne, he was repeatedly denied food and shelter until the bishop, Monseigneur Myriel, welcomed him. Valjean stole the bishop's silverware and fled, but was quickly captured by police. When they returned him to the bishop's house, Myriel protected Valjean by claiming the silverware was a gift and added two silver candlesticks, telling Valjean to use their value to become an honest man. After committing one more theft, Valjean repented.

Adopting the name M. Madeleine, Valjean moved to the town of Montreuil-sur-mer. He renovated the local jet-work industry, started a factory, and brought prosperity to the region, eventually becoming the town's mayor. A woman named Fantine worked in his factory but was fired by a headmistress without his knowledge because she had an illegitimate child, Cosette. To support her daughter, who lived with innkeepers named the Thénardiers, Fantine became a prostitute. After a street disturbance with a local idler, she was arrested by Inspector Javert. As Mayor Madeleine, Valjean intervened, forced Javert to release her, and took the gravely ill Fantine into his home. He promised the dying woman he would find and care for her daughter.

Valjean's new life was threatened when another man was arrested and mistakenly identified as Jean Valjean. After a night of moral conflict, Valjean traveled to the trial at Arras and revealed his true identity to exonerate the accused man. A few days later, Javert arrived at Fantine's bedside to arrest him. The shock of the scene killed Fantine. Valjean was arrested, but he escaped long enough to hide his fortune before being recaptured. He was sent to the military port of Toulon to work on a ship. One day, while saving a sailor from falling from the rigging, Valjean plunged into the sea and faked his own death, making it appear that he had drowned.

Having escaped, Valjean retrieved his buried money from a forest and traveled to Montfermeil. He found Cosette at the Thénardiers' inn, where she was living under their abominable guardianship. He freed the child from the Thénardiers and took her with him to Paris.

In Paris, Valjean and Cosette lived in seclusion in a dilapidated tenement called the Gorbeau House. Despite his precautions, Inspector Javert tracked him down. Valjean was forced to flee abruptly with Cosette. After a hectic chase, he found refuge in a convent. The convent's gardener, Fauchelevent, whose life Valjean had once saved, helped him. Valjean persuaded the prioress to allow him to stay as an assistant gardener and to enroll Cosette as a student. They spent several happy and peaceful years in the isolation of the convent. When Cosette was about fifteen, Valjean decided they should leave so she could experience the world outside.

After leaving the convent, Valjean and Cosette lived quietly in out-of-the-way places. In the Luxembourg Gardens, Cosette and a young student named Marius saw each other and fell in love. When Marius indiscreetly inquired about their address, the ever-cautious Valjean moved without notice. Later, Marius happened to live next door to the Thénardiers and, looking through a hole in the wall, saw them planning to ambush a philanthropist who visited them. He was shocked to see the man, whom he knew as M. Leblanc, was Valjean, and that the man's daughter was Cosette. Marius alerted the police, and Inspector Javert gave him instructions. When Valjean returned, Thénardier trapped him and demanded a ransom. The plot failed when Javert arrived, but during the confusion of the arrests, Valjean escaped.

Thénardier's daughter, who was in love with Marius, found Cosette for him, and the two began a secret relationship. Valjean sensed he was losing Cosette's affection to another man and felt hostile toward him. Disturbed by a secret warning and growing political unrest in Paris, Valjean decided to take Cosette to England and moved them into a hideaway. Despairing at the news of Cosette's departure, Marius decided to seek death by joining a student-led insurrection. He went to a barricade erected in front of the Corinth wine shop. Valjean soon discovered Marius's relationship with Cosette and his presence at the barricade. For Cosette's sake, he decided to protect the young man he abhorred and went to the barricade himself.

At the barricade, Valjean found that Javert had been unmasked as a spy and tied up to await execution. Valjean volunteered for the task of executing him. He led Javert away, but instead of killing him, he spared the inspector's life and sent him away. Valjean then returned to the barricade just as the final assault began. He found Marius seriously wounded and unconscious. Seizing him, Valjean disappeared into a manhole and carried Marius through the Paris sewers to escape.

When Valjean emerged from the sewer exit, Javert was waiting and arrested him. However, Javert allowed Valjean to take Marius to his grandfather's house to recover from his wounds. Afterward, in a state of moral conflict, Javert released Valjean. Unable to reconcile his duty with this act, Javert committed suicide by jumping from a bridge into the Seine.

Marius recovered from his wounds, and his grandfather, M. Gillenormand, consented to his marriage to Cosette. After the wedding, Valjean confessed his criminal past to Marius. Not knowing that Valjean had saved his life, Marius gradually estranged Cosette from Valjean, banishing him from their lives. Without Cosette, Valjean's will to live faded, and he began to wither away. Later, Thénardier attempted to blackmail Marius with information about Valjean, but in doing so, he unwittingly revealed that it was Valjean who had carried Marius through the sewers. Realizing the truth, Marius and Cosette rushed to Valjean's home. They arrived in time for a joyful reunion and to console him on his deathbed. Valjean died content, with Cosette and Marius beside him.
