Jean Valjean was released from prison after serving nineteen years in the galleys for stealing a loaf of bread and for several escape attempts. Upon his release, he arrived in the town of Digne, where he was repeatedly refused shelter. Only Bishop Myriel welcomed him. Valjean stole the bishop's silverware and fled, but was quickly captured by police. When they brought him back, the bishop protected Valjean by pretending the silverware was a gift, telling Valjean he must now live a morally good life. After one more theft, Valjean repented.

Adopting the name M. Madeleine, Valjean moved to the town of Montreuil-sur-mer. He renovated the local jet-work industry, started a factory, and brought prosperity to the town, eventually becoming its mayor. He used more than half of his wealth to help the poor. One of his employees, Fantine, was fired by a head mistress without his knowledge. To support her daughter, Cosette, who was living with innkeepers named the Thenardiers, Fantine became a prostitute. After a public disturbance, she was arrested by Inspector Javert. Valjean, in his capacity as mayor, intervened and forced Javert to release her. Learning her story, he took the gravely ill Fantine into his home and promised to retrieve her daughter for her.

Meanwhile, another man was arrested and mistakenly identified as Jean Valjean. After a night of moral conflict, Valjean decided to reveal his past. He traveled to the trial in Arras, confessed his true identity, and exonerated the accused man. A few days later, Javert came to arrest him at Fantine's bedside. The shock of the scene killed Fantine. Valjean was arrested, but escaped that same night long enough to hide his fortune before being recaptured. He was sent to the military port of Toulon to work on a ship. One day, while saving a sailor, Valjean plunged into the sea and faked his own death, managing to escape as he was believed to have drowned.

Valjean traveled to Montfermeil, where he found Cosette under the abusive guardianship of the Thenardiers. He freed the child from them and took her to Paris, raising her as his own. They lived in a dilapidated tenement called the Gorbeau House until Javert tracked them down. Valjean was forced to flee with Cosette. After a hectic chase, he found refuge in a convent with the help of the gardener, Fauchelevent, a man whose life he had once saved. Valjean became the assistant gardener and enrolled Cosette as a pupil, and they spent several happy years in the convent's isolation.

When Cosette was about fifteen, they left the convent so she could experience the world. While living in out-of-the-way places, Cosette met a young student named Marius in the Luxembourg Gardens, and they fell in love. When Marius made an indiscreet inquiry about her, Valjean, ever cautious, moved them away without leaving an address. Later, Marius discovered his impoverished neighbors were the Thenardiers. He witnessed them setting a trap for a philanthropist he knew as M. Leblanc, whom he recognized as Valjean, accompanied by Cosette. Marius alerted Inspector Javert, then watched as Thenardier tied Valjean up and demanded a ransom. The police raid failed to capture Valjean, who escaped in the confusion.

Eventually, Marius and Cosette were reunited and began a secret relationship. Valjean, disturbed by a warning and growing popular unrest in Paris, decided to take Cosette to England. Learning that Cosette was leaving, a despairing Marius joined a student insurrection, hoping to die at a barricade erected in front of the Corinth wine shop. Valjean discovered Marius's relationship with Cosette and his presence at the barricade. For Cosette's sake, Valjean went to the barricade to protect Marius.

At the barricade, Valjean found that Javert had been unmasked as a spy and was tied up, awaiting execution. Valjean volunteered to execute him, but instead secretly cut his bonds and let him go. When the barricade was finally overtaken by soldiers, Valjean found Marius seriously wounded and unconscious. He carried Marius into a manhole and escaped through the sewers of Paris. At the sewer exit, Javert was waiting and arrested him. However, Javert allowed Valjean to first take Marius to his grandfather's home. Afterwards, Javert released Valjean. Conflicted by this act of mercy, Javert committed suicide by jumping off a bridge.

Marius recovered from his wounds, and his grandfather consented to his marriage to Cosette. After the wedding, Valjean confessed his criminal past to Marius. Because Marius did not know that Valjean had saved his life, he slowly estranged Cosette from Valjean, banishing him from their lives. Without Cosette, Valjean's health failed and he began to waste away. Later, Thenardier, intending to blackmail Marius, unwittingly revealed that it was Valjean who had carried him through the sewers. Marius and Cosette rushed to Valjean's home, where they had a joyful reunion. They arrived in time to console him on his deathbed, and Jean Valjean died content.
