In October 1985, in New York City, the vigilante Rorschach learned of the murder of Edward Blake. Investigating Blake's high-rise apartment, Rorschach discovered a hidden closet containing Blake's costume and weaponry, confirming the victim was the government-sanctioned hero known as The Comedian. Believing this was the start of a plot to eliminate former costumed adventurers, Rorschach developed his "mask-killer" theory and began an investigation, operating outside the law as the Keene Act of 1977 had outlawed unsanctioned vigilantes.

Rorschach started by warning his former colleagues. He visited Dan Dreiberg, the retired Nite Owl, who dismissed his theory. He then met with Adrian Veidt, the former hero Ozymandias, now a successful and respected businessman. Shortly after their meeting, Veidt survived an apparent assassination attempt, which seemed to validate Rorschach's suspicions. Rorschach also visited Doctor Manhattan and Laurie Juspeczyk, the second Silk Spectre, at their government research facility. Soon after, news reports accused Doctor Manhattan of causing cancer in his former associates, prompting the superhuman being to self-exile to Mars. This removed the world's most powerful figure from the equation.

Seeking more information, Rorschach interrogated a former villain, Moloch the Mystic, who was now an old, sick man. Moloch told Rorschach that The Comedian had drunkenly broken into his apartment weeks earlier, talking about a mysterious island. Later, Rorschach received a note telling him to meet Moloch again. Upon arriving at Moloch's apartment, Rorschach found him dead from a gunshot to the head. The police, having received an anonymous tip, immediately surrounded the building. Rorschach was apprehended, forcibly unmasked, and publicly identified as Walter Kovacs.

Framed for Moloch's murder, Walter Kovacs was sent to a prison filled with criminals he had previously captured. He underwent court-ordered psychiatric sessions with Dr. Malcolm Long, during which he revealed his traumatic childhood and the formative case of a kidnapped girl, whose brutal murder solidified his uncompromising worldview. While imprisoned, Kovacs survived multiple attempts on his life by other inmates, including one instance where he threw hot cooking fat in an attacker's face. During a large-scale prison riot, Dreiberg and Juspeczyk, having resumed their heroic identities as Nite Owl and Silk Spectre, broke him out of the facility.

Once free, Rorschach and Nite Owl continued the investigation together. They uncovered evidence that implicated Adrian Veidt as the mastermind behind the entire conspiracy. They flew Nite Owl's airship, Archimedes, to Veidt's Antarctic base, Karnak. There, Veidt confronted them and confessed everything. He admitted to murdering The Comedian, who had discovered his plan; to framing Rorschach for Moloch's murder; to orchestrating the cancer accusations that drove Doctor Manhattan away; and to faking the attempt on his own life.

Veidt revealed that his goal was to avert an imminent nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union by uniting humanity against a common, fabricated enemy. Just as he finished his explanation, he triggered the final stage of his plan. A massive, genetically engineered squid-like creature was teleported into the center of New York City. The creature immediately died, releasing a devastating psychic shockwave that killed half the city's population and traumatized the survivors. As news reports came in, it became clear Veidt's plan had succeeded: the world's superpowers, believing they were under alien attack, immediately ceased their hostilities to face the new threat.

Doctor Manhattan and Silk Spectre arrived at Karnak, having witnessed the destruction in New York firsthand. After a brief confrontation with Veidt, Doctor Manhattan understood the logic of the plan and agreed that exposing the truth would erase the fragile new peace and return the world to the brink of annihilation. Nite Owl, Silk Spectre, and Doctor Manhattan all agreed to remain silent. Rorschach, however, refused to compromise his principles. He declared his intention to expose Veidt's mass murder to the world.

Rorschach walked out of the fortress into the Antarctic snow, challenging Doctor Manhattan to stop him. When Manhattan appeared before him, Rorschach removed his mask, revealing the face of Walter Kovacs, and yelled, "Do it!" Doctor Manhattan then disintegrated him. Unbeknownst to the others, before leaving for Antarctica, Rorschach had mailed his journal—which contained his suspicions and a full account of his investigation—to the *New Frontiersman*, a small, right-wing newspaper. In the paper's office, an editor, looking for content for the next issue, instructed his assistant to find something usable from the "crank file," a stack of unsolicited mail on top of which sat Rorschach's journal.
