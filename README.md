# Things to work on
1. Improve descriptors generation 
   - I think with each descriptor you need an explanation of the descriptor. 
   - If it's a character I think it should be when the character is introduced 
   - maybe you should only am for a couple descriptors in each segment 


2. Improve framwork prompt -- potentially add new arc types 

3. Dynamic Resizing of curves to fit descriptors 
   1. buffer of +5/-5 characters --> if outside buffer generate new descriptors 
   - if inside buffer modify end segment 
   - scale next segment x,y values
