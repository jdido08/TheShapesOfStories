# Vonnegut Graph / The Shapes of Story
This project aims that transforms a given story into a "Vonnegut Graph" i.e. a graph that displays the "shape of a story" where:
1. X-axis: Represents the beginning and end of the story.
2. Represents the character's fortune, ranging from good to bad.

Every story shape as unique and special. Stories aren't just reserved for literature either -- stories exist everywhere: books, movies, plays, games, biographies, etc...
